# Dating-Aggregator-and-Swiper

This is a program that solves two problems in online dating:
1. There are too many sites to choose from
2. There is no rapid-fire way of yes/no filtering results

This program scrapes and aggregates data from several different online dating sites.  The results are then are loaded into a one-page-app that uses JavaScript to let users quickly vote "yes-or-no" on each profile they've encountered.
