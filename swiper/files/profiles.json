I love to play sport badminton,swimming and practice yoga. I have been donating since I have income and occasionally volunteer. During my birthday I gave food/party for children in Thailand. I made food for homeless on my birthday for 2 years in Chicago. YES I have passionate about cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, interested to cook Italian,French,American,Mexican food. but I'm not good at make you coffee even Thai coffee lol , I'm often to gym, lake trail, reading books, movies, and restaurants. I'm shy and a bit nerd. I’m very easy going and caring people. Looking someone who able to share life & laugh. It would be nice if you serious about it.\n ",
